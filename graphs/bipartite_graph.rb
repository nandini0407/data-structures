# A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets,
# U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex
# from V to U. In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V,
# or u belongs to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.
# A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that
# vertices in a set are colored with the same color. Note that it is possible to color a cycle
# graph with even cycle using two colors. It is not possible to color a cycle graph with odd cycle using two colors.
# Following is a simple algorithm to find out whether a given graph is Birpartite or
# not using Breadth First Search (BFS).
# 1.	Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U).
# 2.	Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V).
# 3.	Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U).
# 4.	This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all the constraints of
#     m way coloring problem where m = 2.
# 5. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current
#    vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite)
